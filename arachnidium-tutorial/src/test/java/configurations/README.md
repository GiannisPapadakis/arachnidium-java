Here are parameterized test samples. Parameterization is provided by [JSON configurations](https://github.com/arachnidium/arachnidium-java/tree/master/arachnidium-tutorial/src/test/resources/configs). Parametrs which are defined here use, complement and override parameters from the default [settings.json](https://github.com/arachnidium/arachnidium-java/blob/master/arachnidium-tutorial/src/main/java/com/github/arachnidium/tutorial/confuguration/settings.json). They contain their ownn parameners which are used when requred browser has to be launched.

Enjoy!
