Here is the tutorial where common use cases are presented.

1. Simple use cases:
 
 - [Page and screen objects](https://github.com/arachnidium/arachnidium-java/tree/master/arachnidium-tutorial/src/main/java/com/github/arachnidium/tutorial/simple)
 
 - [Test examples](https://github.com/arachnidium/arachnidium-java/tree/master/arachnidium-tutorial/src/test/java/simple)

2. Configurations.

 - [default parameters](https://github.com/arachnidium/arachnidium-java/tree/master/arachnidium-tutorial/src/main/java/com/github/arachnidium/tutorial/confuguration)
 
 - [additioanal and customized parameters](https://github.com/arachnidium/arachnidium-java/tree/master/arachnidium-tutorial/src/test/resources/configs)
 
 - [examples of parameterized tests](https://github.com/arachnidium/arachnidium-java/tree/master/arachnidium-tutorial/src/test/java/configurations).
 

3. Special about page objects and the modeling:
 
 - Browser client (Drive Google is used as an application under tests)
    - [Tests. From complecated code to simplified](https://github.com/arachnidium/arachnidium-java/tree/master/arachnidium-tutorial/src/test/java/modeling/web);
   
    - [Page obgects without special annotations and aggregated application representation](https://github.com/arachnidium/arachnidium-java/tree/master/arachnidium-tutorial/src/main/java/com/github/arachnidium/tutorial/app_modeling/web/unannotated_pageobjects)
    - [Page obgects with special annotations and aggregated application representation](https://github.com/arachnidium/arachnidium-java/tree/master/arachnidium-tutorial/src/main/java/com/github/arachnidium/tutorial/app_modeling/web/annotated_pageobjects)
 
 - Mobile client. Native content (Hermitage Museum (Android) is used as an application under tests)
     - [Tests. From complecated code to simplified](https://github.com/arachnidium/arachnidium-java/tree/master/arachnidium-tutorial/src/test/java/modeling/mobile/native_android_app);
   
    - [Screen obgects without special annotations and aggregated application representation](https://github.com/arachnidium/arachnidium-java/tree/master/arachnidium-tutorial/src/main/java/com/github/arachnidium/tutorial/app_modeling/mobile/native_app/unannotated_pageobjects)
    - [Page obgects with special annotations and aggregated application representation](https://github.com/arachnidium/arachnidium-java/tree/master/arachnidium-tutorial/src/main/java/com/github/arachnidium/tutorial/app_modeling/mobile/native_app/annotated_pageobjects)

 - Mobile client. WebView content (UICatalog (iOS) is used as an application under tests)
     - [Tests. From complecated code to simplified](https://github.com/arachnidium/arachnidium-java/tree/master/arachnidium-tutorial/src/test/java/modeling/mobile/hybrid_ios_app);
